# **Sequence**

Artella organizes a short film, as in real film production, in sequences. Those sequences are containers that stores 
all the shots of the short film.

When you create a new sequence, Artella creates two folders automatically:

***

## **_editorial**

This folder is where all files generated by each department are stored. For instance, when you've moved into animation 
the .mov files that are generated should be put in the _editorial/anim folder.

***

## **_master_layout**
This folder is the **bridge** between Assets and Sequences.
