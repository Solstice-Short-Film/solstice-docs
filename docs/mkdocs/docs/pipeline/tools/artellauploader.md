> {{ project.name }} Artella Uploader
![Sync Process](../../../img/tools/artellauploader/1.png?style=centerme)


## **How it works?**

1. You select a path inside your local {{ project.name }} Project in your local drive. The tool will show you all the files located inside that folder.
2. In the files list you need to check/uncheck the files you want to work with.

Now you have 3 different options:

<center>

|    |      Name      |   Description    |
| -------- |:-------------:| :---------:|
| ![Lock icon](../../img/icons/lock.png?style=centerme) | **Lock File** |  Lock all the checked files in Artella server. |
| ![Unlock icon](../../img/icons/unlock.png?style=centerme) | **Unlock File** |  Unlock all the checked files in Artella server. |
| ![Upload icon](../../img/icons/upload.png?style=centerme) | **Make New Version** |  Uploads a new version into Artella server of all the checked files. |

</center>

!!! important
    When uploading new version of files that are already in Artella server, you need to make sure that all the files
    are locked.
